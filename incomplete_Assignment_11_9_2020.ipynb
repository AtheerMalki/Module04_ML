    "In this assignment we will be engaging with the stock price data for several hundred stocks over 5 years (./Data/prices-split-adjusted.csv.zip).  The data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse#prices-split-adjusted.csv) and is available in its original form there under a CC0 license. (It's 50MB, but compressed it's only 15)\n",

    "In this notebook we will be looking at financial forecasting with machine learning.  This is inherently one of the hardest problems in machine learning, because some of the most advanced and well-funded technical teams in the world are trying to use machine learning and other techniques to find patterns in the financial data.  When they find patterns and if they trade on those findings, prices will move in a way that makes those patterns less pronounced over time. This is not to say that this is not a fun and rewarding area.  Just do not get discouraged if you don't find an instant money machine.  \n",

    "Machine learning is of increasing importance in finance. As volumes of data grow ever faster, the need for machine driven models to find patterns in that data becomes ever more important.  In the ever-accelerating race to better process data into predictions about securities prices, machine learning has become an important tool, because it is good at finding patterns in large amounts of data.  Today we will be examining patterns in stock prices themselves to practice developing models to predict future set prices. If there are systematic trends, patterns or reversals, then we may detect them. \n",

For this data exploration, we can think of the index into the data as being a a compound key of both the symbol (the ticker) and the date.
